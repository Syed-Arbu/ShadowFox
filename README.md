Beginner Task – ShadowFox Data Science Internship

This folder contains my submission for the Beginner Level Task of the ShadowFox Data Science Internship.

📌 Task Objective
The goal of this task was to study, compare, and document data visualization libraries commonly used in Python.
Visualization is one of the most important steps in data science because it helps us understand trends, patterns, and insights hidden inside raw data.

🛠️ Work Done
Selected Libraries → Explored Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Graph Types Implemented → Line, Bar, Scatter, Histogram, Pie, Heatmap, etc.
For each graph:
✔️ Added description
✔️ Provided real-life use case
✔️ Wrote a simple Python code example

Comparison Table → Highlighted differences in terms of:
Ease of use
Customization
Interactivity
Large dataset handling

📂 Files in this Folder
beginner_task.ipynb → Jupyter/Colab notebook with all code examples and plots.
Beginner_Task_Documentation.pdf → Detailed documentation of visualization libraries, graph types, and comparison.
screenshots/ → Sample output images from the notebook

✅ Outcome / Learning
Strengthened understanding of how different visualization libraries work.
Learned when to use each library (static plots, customized plots, or interactive dashboards).
Built a reference guide that can be reused for future analysis and projects.
