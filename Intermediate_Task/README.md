Intermediate Task – ShadowFox Data Science Internship
This folder contains my submission for the Intermediate Level Task of the ShadowFox Data Science Internship.

📌 Task Objective
The goal of this task was to perform data analysis and visualization on the Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset for Delhi. The objective was to understand pollution trends, seasonal variation, and key pollutants that impact air quality.

🛠️ Work Done
Data Collection
Used the provided Delhi AQI dataset (CSV format).
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values and formatted date-time columns.
Converted categorical and numerical features into usable formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, O₃).
Studied seasonal and yearly patterns in AQI levels.
Compared results with WHO/National standards.
Visualizations
Line plots for AQI trends over time.
Heatmaps for correlation between pollutants.
Seasonal distribution graphs to observe variation across months.
